 A Basic Expense Tracker with ttkBootstrap and SQLite3

![main.py](/img/main.png)
> Preview Expenses

![ui_request.py](/img/add_expense.png)
> Add Expense

## How to Use.
 1. Open the ```main.py``` file to view the expenses and the ```ui_request.py``` to add to the expenses database.

 1. The user adds a record to the tracker database in which the sqlite3 database records the data the user enters.

 1. The user can also choose to delete the last record from the database and also clear all the records from the table.

 1. Creating a button to open a window and still retain the files is not allowed so the window was created  in another file and a button was made to open up the window.

 

> Note -> Ignore the python interpreter window

## Things to Note.
 1. The transaction amount tab will be green for income (gaining money).

 1. The transaction amount tab will be red for expenses (spending money).

 1. The Satisfaction amount will be green if the user chooses to be satisfied with the transaction he made.

 1. The Satisfaction amount will be red if the user chooses to not be satisfied with the transaction he made.
